/**_ Position:- _**/

**absolute :-** the element we make as absolute it will go up (Z-axis) and the below items take its place where it before.
Jo bhi element absolute hot hai wo uper uth jaata hai and agr tumne us element ki move kiya to wo kisi ke uper bhi aa skta hai.

_Note_ :- koi bhi element jispe position nahi hai uspar top bottom left right and z-index nam ki property kam nahi krti

**relative :-** If we make the outer elemwnt as relative then the inner element which is absolute can not go out of the outer element which is the relative. The absolute elements make ist boundary as per the outer element wich is relative.
if there is no element which is relative then the absolute elemetn take the whole screen as a boundry

**fixed :-** if we make the element as a fixed it will stay on its set position if we scroll it will not scroll with the page
