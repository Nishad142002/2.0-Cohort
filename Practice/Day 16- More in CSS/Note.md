**CSS boiler plate explanation**

\* {:- Universal selector (Select all the element everything)
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
**box-sizing: border-box; -** this property limtis the height and width of the div if we add the border to the div it will add that border height to the existing height of the div eg. if the height weidth of div is 100px and border is 5px then the new height is 110px and this is problem so when we apply box-sizing then the height is set to 100px it will not increase after if add border
}

**perseptive property :-** this property apply to the body this help wo chnage the perspective of seeing the web page
when we use the transform - rotatX or Y normaly we can not see the exact changes which happning so we use yhe perspective property in body to change the perspective in this we give the value in px like 200px or 1000px so we see the chage which happen by rotet property
