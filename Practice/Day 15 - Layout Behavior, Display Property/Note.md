In this class we leran the transform property

And then we learn the reals cross axis and main axis the disply flex work on the cross and main axis.

when we do the "flex-direction = column" then the vertical line (Y-axis) becomes the main axis and the horizontal line(X-axis) become the cross axis

default the "flex-direction" is "row" in this the vertical line (Y-axis) is cross axis and horizontal line(X-axios) is main axis

so the align-item property work on the cross axis and the justify-content property work on the main-axis
